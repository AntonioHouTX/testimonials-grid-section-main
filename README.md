## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

In this project I learned to combine CSS Grid with CSS Flexbox.  Some of the sample code that demonstrates this is:

```css
.name {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-left: 1rem;
}
```
```css
.container {
    max-width: 90rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  }
```
### Continued development

Some techniques that I would like to refine and perfect for future projects are reconciling the various desktop display pixel widths in existence and trying to find a "happy medium" that allows a website to render properly on the greatest number of different screen widths possible.  In this project, as shown above, I did use a "max-width: 90rem" to properly render the page on my 24" iMac, even though it is my understanding that it is poor CSS practice.  

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Once again, straight from the horse's mouth, the ultimate reference to HTML & CSS from the people of the W3C proved an invaluable resource.
